### Problems with Media Queries

Media queries are great! Sort of.

- Basing breakpoints on the viewport dimensions isn't very descriptive
- Components that are reused in different contexts require extra _stuff_ to work properly
- The more complicated the layout, the more media queries you need, increasing the likelihood of visual bugs
