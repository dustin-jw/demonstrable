### Protecting Data at Rest

- Do not store sensitive data unnecessarily, but encrypt the data that does need to be stored
- Do not use weak or old cryptographic algorithms or protocols or deprecated hash functions (MD5 or SHA1, for example)
- Practice proper key management and ensure that they are generated cryptographically randomly
