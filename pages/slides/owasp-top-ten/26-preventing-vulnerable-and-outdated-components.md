### Preventing Vulnerable and Outdated Components

There should be a patch management process in place.

- Remove unused dependencies
- Continuously inventory components and their dependencies using automated tools (such as Dependabot for npm updates)
- Only obtain components from official sources over secure links
- Monitor for unmaintained libraries or dependencies, including ones that do not patch older versions
