### Broken Access Control Vulnerabilities

- Tampering with URLs, cookies, JWTs, or application state to gain access to restricted resources
- Missing access controls for API methods, CORS misconfiguration, or not following the principle of least privilege (deny by default)
- Elevation of privelege. Acting as a user without logging in, or a user acting as an admin
