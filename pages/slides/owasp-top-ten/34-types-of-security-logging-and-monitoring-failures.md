  Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
</h3>

If you aren't aware of a breach, you can't respond to it. Logging,
detection, monitoring, and active responses are likely insufficient if:

- Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, are not logged
- Warnings and errors don't log messages, or they generate unclear or inadequate messages.
- Logs are not monitored for suspicious activity
- Logs are only stored locally
- Alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective
- Penetration tests and scans to not trigger alerts
- The application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for attacks in or near real-time
