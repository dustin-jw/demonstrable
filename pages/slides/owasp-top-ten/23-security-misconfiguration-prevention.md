### Security Misconfiguration Prevention

- Development, QA, and Production environments should all be configured identically, but use different credentials
- Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks
- Regularly review configurations and permissions, especially when applying patches
- Automate configuration as much as possible to minimize manual errors
