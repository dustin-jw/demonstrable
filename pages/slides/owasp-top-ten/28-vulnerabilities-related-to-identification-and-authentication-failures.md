  Identification and Authentication Failures
</h3>

Authentication weaknesses make it easier for attackers to gain access to user accounts. Applications may be vulnerable to authentication-related attacks if:

- There is no protection against automated attacks, including when the attacker has valid usernames/passwords
- Weak, default, or well-known passwords are allowed ("Password1")
- Weak or ineffective account recovery methods are used, such as knowledge-based security questions
- Multi-factor authentication is missing or ineffective
- Session identifiers are exposed in the URL, reused after a successful login, or incorrectly invalidated after logout
