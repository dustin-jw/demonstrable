<h3>
  Insecure Design

    Definition

</h3>

This is a broad category that covers risks related to design and architectural flaws. The other items in the Top 10 would be considered "insecure implementation", whereas this can apply to the design of a system before any code is even written.

The lack of risk profiling can lead to these design problems, as threats are not considered early enough to effectively prevent them.

Threat modeling should be a regular part of the development lifecycle, and any risks should be considered and included in user stories and reviewed in PRs.
