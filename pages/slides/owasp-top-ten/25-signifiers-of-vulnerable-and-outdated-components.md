  Vulnerable and Outdated Components
</h3>

An application is likely vulnerable if:

- Software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date
- There is no regular process to scan for vulnerabilities or to be alerted to security advisories
- Dependencies are not fixed or updated in a timely fashion (for example, updating monthly rather than when security updates are released)
- Updated, upgraded, or patched libraries are not tested for compatibility
