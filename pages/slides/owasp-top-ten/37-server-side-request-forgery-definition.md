SSRF flaws occur when applications fetch remote resources without validating user-supplied URLs. These attacks can often bypass security measures such as firewalls, VPNs, or access control lists.

This can allow attackers to scan internal servers for open ports, access sensitive data either from files or localhost ports, or perform Remote Code Execution or Denial of Service attacks.
