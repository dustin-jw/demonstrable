## ðŸš¨ Edge Case City ðŸš¨

I skipped some details for simplicity, but we had some other things to contend with, including:

- Updating `hreflang` URLs
- Handling images loaded via CSS
- Replacing forms that depended on the old CMS
- Finding localized versions of the page that weren't planned for migration
- Keeping track of which pages had already been migrated
- Writing CSV/JSON reports to track any errors that happened during migration
- So much routing and redirect logic
